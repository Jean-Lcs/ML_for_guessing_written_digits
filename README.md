# ML_for_guessing_written_digits

![Cover](https://github.com/Jean-Lcs/ML_for_guessing_written_digits/blob/main/ML_digits.jpeg)

This project is a famous example of machine learning.
Thanks to the keras library, we have data of written diggits and the purpose is to train an ML algorithm in order to predict what is the correct output.
I wanted to explain well the number of variable, the loss function etc so I tried to be as clear as possible and to plot any interesting thing.

We end up with a 93% efficiency which is quite satisfying!
